To start the game, run the simpleGame.py file. 
The current app.py file is the original version of the game app before refactoring to separate game and app. It is not the main app file and should not be run as the entry point (unless you want to explore an older build).

To use the llm generated output dialogue go to negotiator.py and replace API_KEY with your own OpenAI API Key. Likewise you can change the model used in the negotiator class.
